Some of my favorite resources from around the web. Unordered for now, will split into sections and add more as I get to categorizing my many bookmarks.

### Blogs and articles

- [Matklad](https://matklad.github.io/)
    - lots of great stuff, some Rust-specific, but also other wide-ranging topics, and short-and-sweet software design
        nuggets like [this](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html) and [this](https://matklad.github.io/2023/09/13/comparative-analysis.html)
- [Jamie Brandon](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/)
    - His [Reflections on a decade of coding](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/reflections-on-a-decade-of-coding/) resonated strongly with me, in particular the [advice on coding](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/coding/) and the focus on "what do I want the machine to do".
    - He also runs [HYTRADBOI](https://www.hytradboi.com/), a cool online conference filled with great short talks.
- [Alexis King](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/): Haskell, type-driven development
    - [Parse, don’t validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
    - [No, dynamic type systems are not inherently more open](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/01/19/no-dynamic-type-systems-are-not-inherently-more-open/)
    - [Names are not type safety](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2020/11/01/names-are-not-type-safety/)
- [Hillel Wayne](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/): Known for formal methods, but many other topics as well
    - [Constructive vs Predicative Data](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/constructive/)
- [Squishy Computer, by Gordon Brander](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/): not necessarily about software design, but very interesting explorations
    - [All you need is links](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/all-you-need-is-links)
- [Fernando Borretti](https://borretti.me/article/)
    - [Type Systems for Memory Safety](https://borretti.me/article/type-systems-memory-safety)
- [Without boats, dreams dry up](https://without.boats/) – Rust
    - [Why async Rust?](https://without.boats/blog/why-async-rust/)
- [Ryan Carniato - DEV Community](https://dev.to/ryansolid): Ryan's articles were my introduction to "low-level" JS and how frameworks like Solid and Marko work. His [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ryansolid) has long, in-depth streams on modern front-end topics
